# PowerShell IT Automation Scripts

## Overview

The **LoadIntoProfile** project provides a comprehensive suite of PowerShell scripts designed for automating IT Tier 1/2 tasks. These scripts enhance efficiency by handling common administrative tasks such as software installations, system cleanups, Active Directory account management, and hardware diagnostics.

## Features

- **Script Loading Automation**: Dynamically loads all PowerShell scripts in the specified development directory for quick access and execution.
- **Software Management**:
  - Automates downloads and installations for popular tools like VMware Horizon, Adobe Acrobat, GlobalProtect, Zoom, and more.
  - Uses secure TLS 1.2 connections for file downloads.
- **Active Directory Integration**: Includes tools for unlocking user accounts and retrieving user information.
- **System Cleanup**: Aggressively removes temporary files, caches, and logs to free up system space and improve performance.
- **Hardware Diagnostics**: Retrieves detailed hardware and system information, including BIOS, motherboard, processor, disk drives, and network configuration.
- **Flexible Customization**: Modular design allows users to add or modify functionality with minimal effort.
- **Error Handling**: Extensive error handling ensures smooth execution, with detailed logs for troubleshooting.

## Requirements

- PowerShell 5.0 or higher.
- Administrative privileges for certain operations (e.g., cleaning temporary files, installing software).
- Network connectivity for downloading files.
- Active Directory module (for scripts involving AD operations).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone or Download**: 
   - Clone this repository or download the ZIP file to your local machine.
2. **Prepare JSON Configuration**:
   - Add a `install_paths.json` file in the `LoadIntoProfile` directory to define installer paths, documentation links, and server names for software.
3. **Set Development Path**:
   - Update the `$DevPath` variable in the script to point to your local `LoadIntoProfile` folder.
4. **Run the Loader**:
   - Execute the main script to dynamically load all modules:
     - Edit the user profile
       ```powershell
       notepad $PROFILE
       ```
     - or get the path for it and open in another IDE
       ```powershell
       $PROFILE
       ```
          
     
     - In your profile insert the code from profile.ps1 or call the profile.ps1 directly to load in the scripts
     - Be sure to update the dev path so that it can find the "LoadIntoProfile" directory
5. **Execute Functions**:
   - Use the provided functions interactively or incorporate them into larger workflows.
